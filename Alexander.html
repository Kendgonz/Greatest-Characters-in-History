          Alexander the Great, also known as Alexander III or Alexander of
          Macedonia is known as one of the greatest generals in all history.
          Alexander was born in 356 B.C.E. in Pella, Macedonia, to King Philip
          II. As a young boy, Alexander was taught to read, write, and play the
          lyre. He developed a life-long love of reading and music. When
          Alexander was a teenager, his father hired Aristotle to be his private
          tutor. He studied with Aristotle for three years and from Aristotleâ€™s
          teachings, Alexander developed a love of science, particularly of
          medicine and botany. Alexander included botanists and scientists in
          his army to study the lands he conquered.

          In 336 B.C.E., at age 20, Alexander became king of Macedonia when a
          political rival assassinated his father. Alexander began his reign by
          subduing rivals in the Greek and Macedonian regions. At a council of
          the League of Corinth, he was chosen as the commander of a military
          invasion of Asia. King Alexander began his invasion of the Middle East
          in 334 B.C.E. He spent most of his reign on a military campaign
          through northeast Africa and southwestern Asia. Alexander built many
          new cities in the lands he conquered, including Alexandria in Egypt.
          He went on to conquer the lands of the Persian Empire, establishing
          more cities, and like Alexandria, often naming them after himself. His
          conquest continued through Asia until he reached the shores of the
          Ganga (Ganges) River in India. At this point, his army refused to
          continue further into India, exhausted and discouraged by heavy rains.
          Alexander was 32 when he died in 323 B.C.E. During his 13-year reign
          as the king of Macedonia, Alexander created one of the largest empires
          of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.
