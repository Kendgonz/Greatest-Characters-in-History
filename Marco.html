        <p>
          Marcus Aurelius was chosen by Emporer Hadrian to be his eventual
          successor. In 161, Aurelius took control of the Roman Empire along
          with his brother Verus. War and disease threatened Rome on all sides.
          Aurelius held his territory, but was weakened as a ruler after the
          death of his brother Verus. His son Commodus later became co-ruler in
          177, only three years before Aurelius died on March 17, 180.

          After his adoptive father died in 161, Aurelius rose to power and was
          officially then known as Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus. While
          some sources indicate that Antoninus selected him as his only
          successor, Aurelius insisted that his adopted brother served as his
          co-ruler. His brother was Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.
          <br />
          Marcus Aurelius died on March 17, 180. His son Commodus became emperor
          and soon ended the northern military efforts. Marcus Aurelius,
          however, is not best remembered for the wars he waged, but for his
          contemplative nature and his rule driven by reason. A collection of
          his thoughts have been published in a work called The Meditations.
          Based on his Stoic beliefs, the work is filled with his notes on life.
