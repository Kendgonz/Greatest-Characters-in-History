      <h2>Julius Cesar</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Julius Caesar was a Roman general and politician who named himself
          dictator of the Roman Empire, a rule that lasted less than one year
          before he was famously assassinated by political rivals in 44 B.C.E.
          Caesar was born on July 12 or 13 in 100 B.C.E. to a noble family.
          During his youth, the Roman Republic was in chaos. Seizing the
          opportunity, Caesar advanced in the political system and briefly
          became governor of Spain, a Roman province.

          Returning to Rome, he formed political alliances that helped him
          become governor of Gaul, an area that included what is now France and
          Belgium. His Roman troops conquered Gallic tribes by exploiting tribal
          rivalries. Throughout his eight-year governorship, he increased his
          military power and, more importantly, acquired plunder from Gaul. When
          his rivals in Rome demanded he return as a private citizen, he used
          these riches to support his army and marched them across the Rubicon
          River, crossing from Gaul into Italy. This sparked a civil war between
          Caesar’s forces and forces of his chief rival for power, Pompey, from
          which Caesar emerged victorious. Returning to Italy, Caesar
          consolidated his power and made himself dictator. He wielded his power
          to enlarge the senate, created needed government reforms, and
          decreased Rome’s debt. At the same time, he sponsored the building of
          the Forum Iulium and rebuilt two city-states, Carthage and Corinth. He
          also granted citizenship to foreigners living within the Roman
          Republic. In 44 B.C.E., Caesar declared himself dictator for life. His
          increasing power and great ambition agitated many senators who feared
          Caesar aspired to be king. Only a month after Caesar’s declaration, a
          group of senators, among them Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar’s second
          choice as heir, and Gaius Cassius Longinus assassinated Caesar in fear
          of his absolute power.
